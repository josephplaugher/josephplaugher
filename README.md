#### Lift
A simple and effective app designed for people who strength train to track their workouts and monitor progress. I designed it with powerlifters and weightlifters in mind, but it can be used to track any kind of strength training. The front end is built in react with typescript. The backend is built in [nestjs](https://nestjs.com/) with typescript.<br/>

### Work completed while with my previous employer
#### Carbon Calculator 
This is a carbon emission calculator designed to estimate the reduction in carbon emission by switching from trucking to CPKS's railroad system for your logistics needs.
I was a major contributor to this application.<br/> 
I built the majority of the front-end and a significant portion of the back-end.<br/>

#### Flood Plan Viewer
This is a tool that interactively displays information about flooding, flood risk, and flood risk mitigation in the State of Texas. There are 9 interactive maps containing detailed information on the topics. Users are able to submit requests to have any missing flood risk information added to it.

#### Roadway Characteristic Inventory Viewer
This is a tool that provides a multi-dimmensional view of every roadway in the State of Florida. There is a an image at each milepoint (must be logged in to see the images), an interactive map, tabular data, and the core of the application - a straight-line diagram. A straight-line diagram provides highly detailed information about dozens of characteristics of a given roadway. When I left HDR, this application was in beta testing. I will post a link to it when it is live and available to the public.
