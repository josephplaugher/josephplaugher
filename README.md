### Past work (while at HDR)
Carbon Calculator. This is a carbon emission calculator designed to estimate the reduction in carbon emission by switching from trucking to CPKS's railroad system for your logistics needs.
I was a major contributor to this application.<br/> 
I built the majority of the front-end and a significant portion of the back-end.<br/>

Flood Plan Viewer. This is a tool that interactively displays information about flooding, flood risk, and flood risk mitigation in the State of Texas. There are 9 interactive maps containing detailed information on the topics. Users are able to submit requests to have any missing flood risk information added to it.

These are the public facing apps I built while with HDR. I also built a variety of non-public facing apps using some combination of React and .NET.
